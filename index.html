            <h3>Hello.</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer based in Abuja, Nigeria.
                I am passionate about providing value for my customers.
                Over the years, I have acquired different IT skills in YouTubing, SEO for website, running facebook ads and some I will adding below.

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I started my coding journey when I was in college because
                I fell in love with for no reason and right now, I have acquired
                a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web
                applications that is fully responsive and highly engaging.</p>

            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>After understanding how to code, I came across a course teaching how to design website from Chris Barin Dorin.
                I needed to know the difference between developing and designing, so that's how I took the course from a premium friend of mine and I learnt how to 
                design websites and mobile application interfaces using photoshop but currently, I design using Figma.
